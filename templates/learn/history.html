The Monero project begins with the introduction of the CryptoNote protocol in early 2014. A group of people (possibly a single person) created the protocol using a wide variety of pseudonyms. In the source code of the protocol, there are many copyright references to Andrey N. Sabelnikov who is associated with the botnet Kelihos. It is suspected that he played a role in the development of the CryptoNote Protocol. The first cryptocurrency to make use of the CryptoNote protocol was Bytecoin. Many members of the cryptocurrency community were concerned about the lack of transparency from the Bytecoin development team. As a result, numerous copies of the CryptoNote protocol were made and many teams attemped to launch their own version of the CryptoNote protocol. Bitmonero was one of these copies. Within the Bitmonero team, there was still major disagreement about the distribution and branding of the project. A group of community members again copied the source code of Bitmonero and created Monero. This all happened over the course of a month between March and April 2014. Much of the discussion that took place amongst the earliest developers of monero can still be found in the BitcoinTalk threads listed below.
